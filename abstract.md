# Summer is Coming: AI for R, Shiny, and Pharma

R users tend to be skeptical of modern AI models, given our weird insistence on answers being accurate, or at least supported by the data. But I believe the time has come---or maybe it's a little late---for even the most AI-cynical among us to push past the gag reflex and get informed about what these tools are truly capable of. And key to that is moving beyond _using_ AI-enabled apps, and towards _building_ our own scripts, packages, and apps that make judicious use of AI.

In this talk, I'll tell you why I believe AI has more to offer the R community than just wrong answers from chat windows or mediocre code suggestions in our IDEs. I'll also introduce new tools we've developed at Posit that put powerful AI tools within reach of every R user. And finally, I'll show how adding some AI could make your next Shiny app dramatically more useful for your users.
